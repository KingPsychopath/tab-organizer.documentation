        <blockquote>
          <p>A selected tab is one that you have selected, for instance with <code class="key">Ctrl</code> or <code class="key">Shift</code>. These show up as green within Tab Organizer.</p>
          <p>A focused tab is one that is currently focused within Chrome. These show up as tan/orange within Tab Organizer.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Absolutely! I put quite a bit of work into making sure that it is possible to do everything with the keyboard only.</p>
          <p>Some things (like moving tabs) are more difficult with the keyboard, but it's still possible.</p>

        <h3 id="what-are-special-queries">What are special queries?</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Special queries are designed to make it easier to find certain types of tabs.</p>
          <p>As an example, you can use the <code>same:url</code> special query to find all tabs that have the same URL.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3 id="how-do-use-special-queries">How do I use special queries?</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Just type them into the search box. You can also combine special queries and advanced syntax.</p>
          <p>For instance, <code>same:url | google</code> will find all tabs that have the same URL, and also the tabs that contain the text <span class="match">google</span>.</p>

            </li>

            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>is:bookmarked</code></span>

            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>is:broken</code></span>
              <p>Shows the tabs that "broken", like a 404 error or the server not responding. The detection isn't perfect, so it may match a tab that isn't broken, and it might not match a tab that is broken.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>is:child</code></span>
              <p>Shows the tabs that are children of another tab (indented).</p>

            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>is:image</code></span>
              <p>Shows the tabs that are <a href="http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/images/2007/12/29/caturday_flowchart.jpg">images</a>.</p>

            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>is:pinned</code></span>
              <p>Shows the tabs that are pinned within Chrome.</p>

            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>is:selected</code></span>
              <p>Shows tabs that have been selected (for instance, with <code class="key">Ctrl</code> or <code class="key">Shift</code>).</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>last:moved</code></span>
              <p>Shows the tabs that were last moved. This includes tabs that were moved by a macro.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>same:domain</code></span>
              <p>Shows tabs whose domains are the same. As an example, two or more tabs on the <span class="match">www.google.com</span> domain would match. If a domain is used by only a single tab, that tab will not be shown.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>same:path</code></span>
              <p>Shows tabs whose domain + path is the same. This is useful for finding similar tabs.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>same:title</code></span>
              <p>Shows tabs whose titles are the same. This is useful for finding duplicate tabs.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>same:url</code></span>
              <p>Shows tabs whose URLs are the same. This is useful for finding duplicate tabs.</p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> this excludes trailing slashes and hash fragments. That means that <a href="http://foo/bar/">http://foo/bar/</a> and <a href="http://foo/bar#qux">http://foo/bar#qux</a> are treated as the same URL.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>seen:url</code></span>
              <p>Shows tabs that you have seen (within Chrome), based on their URL.</p>

            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>will:move</code></span>
              <p>Shows the tabs that will be moved, if you use <span class="action">Apply all macros</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>window:</code></span>
              <p>Shows tabs that are within a certain window. For instance, <code>window:5</code> would show all the tabs in the window named <span class="match">5</span>.</p>
              <p>You can also use a comma to easily show multiple windows at once: <code>window:3,5,9</code></p>
              <p>And you can use a dash to show windows in sequence: <code>window:1-5</code></p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> this works with custom names too. If you rename a window <span class="match">foo</span>, you can show it with <code>window:foo</code></p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> there is a special value called <code>focused</code> that will show the window that is focused within Chrome.</p>
              <p>For instance, <code>window:focused</code> will show the focused window, and <code>window:1-5,focused</code> will show windows <span class="match">1</span> through <span class="match">5</span>, and the focused window.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3 id="why-inurl-or-intitle">What's the point of <em>inurl:</em> and <em>intitle:</em>?</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p><code>inurl:</code> is useful when searching for things that are only found in URLs, like hash fragments or URL queries:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>inurl:#</code></li>
            <li><code>inurl:?</code></li>
            <li><code>inurl:https://</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p><code>intitle:</code> is useful when you want to <em>exclude</em> things that normally appear in the URL. For instance, let's say you have a tab whose title contains the phrase <span class="match">http</span>.</p>
          <p>If you typed in <code>http</code> it would probably match most of your tabs, because URLs often start with <span class="match">http://</span> On the other hand, you can use <code>intitle:http</code> to find the correct tab.</p>
          <p>Another example is searching for the phrase <span class="match">com</span>. Websites often have that in the URL, so using <code>intitle:com</code> will filter those out.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3 id="what-is-advanced-syntax">You mentioned advanced syntax, what's that?</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Advanced syntax is a way to combine queries together to make your searches even more accurate, helping you to find the exact tabs you want.</p>
          <p>If you have used Google Search, you may already know that it supports advanced syntax. Tab Organizer is very similar. Here is a list of the advanced syntax supported by Tab Organizer:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>-</code></span>
              <p>Excludes an item from the search. For instance, <code>-google</code> would show all tabs that do <em>not</em> contain the text <span class="match">google</span>.</p>
              <p>This works with special queries as well. For instance, you can use <code>-window:5</code> to show every window <em>except</em> the window named <span class="match">5</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>,</code></span>
              <p>This only works with special queries. It's an easier way to write <code>OR</code>.</p>
              <p>For example, the query <code>same:url,title</code> is the same as <code>same:url | same:title</code></p>
              <p>And the query <code>inurl:google,wiki</code> is the same as <code>inurl:google | inurl:wiki</code></p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> this only works within one prefix. That means you can't do things like <code>has:macro,is:pinned</code>. You'll need to use <code>has:macro | is:pinned</code>. However, you can do things like this: <code>has:macro | is:pinned,image</code></p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><em>Space</em></span>
              <p>Using a space is the same as logical AND. This narrows your search to be more specific.</p>
              <p>For instance, <code>wikipedia chrome</code> would show tabs that match both <span class="match">wikipedia</span> <em>and</em> <span class="match">chrome</span> at the same time.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>OR</code></span>
              <p>This <em>adds</em> items to the search. For instance, <code>google OR youtube</code> would show tabs that match either <span class="match">google</span> or <span class="match">youtube</span>.</p>
              <p>You can also use the <code>|</code> character, like this: <code>google | youtube</code></p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>( )</code></span>
              <p>Ordinarily, AND has higher precedence than OR, but you can use parentheses to override that, like so: <code>foo (bar | qux)</code></p>
              <p>You can also use them to do some pretty complicated stuff. For instance, <code>-(foo | bar)</code> is equivalent to <code>-foo -bar</code>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>"</code> <em>foo</em> <code>"</code></span>
              <p>This is a shortcut for <code>r/\b</code> <em><strong>foo</strong></em> <code>\b/i</code></p>
              <p>That means <code>"foo"</code> is the same as <code>r/\bfoo\b/i</code></p>
              <p>This is used to find a word, while not allowing sub-word matches. For instance, <code>"foo"</code> would match <span class="match">foo</span>, <span class="match">foo bar</span>, or <span class="match">bar foo</span>, but would not match <span class="match">foobar</span>.</p>

            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>r/</code> <em>regexp</em> <code>/</code> <em>[flags]</em></span>
              <p>This gives you the full power of JavaScript's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regexp</a> engine.</p>
              <p>For instance, <code>r/^foo(bar)?$/</code> would find tabs that match <span class="match">foo</span> or <span class="match">foobar</span>, but the word must occur at the start and end. That means it would <em>not</em> match <span class="match">foo bar</span>, <span class="match">barfoo</span>, or <span class="match">bar foo</span>. It is also case-sensitive, so it would not match <span class="match">Foo</span> or <span class="match">fooBaR</span>.</p>
              <p>If you want it to be case-insensitive, you can place the <code>i</code> flag after the closing slash, like this: <code>r/foo/i</code> Currently, the only flag that is supported is <code>i</code>.</p>
              <p>Regexps are usually too complicated and clunky to search with, but they can be very useful when used with macros.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can combine the above as much as you like. For instance, <code>same:url google | window:bar -inurl:youtube</code> would show the tabs that have the same URL and match <span class="match">google</span>, but also the tabs that are in the window named <span class="match">bar</span>, but not those that have <span class="match">youtube</span> in their URL.</p>

          <p>AND has higher precedence. This can be overriden with parentheses (see above). That means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>foo bar | qux</code>
              <p>(foo AND bar) OR qux</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Macros let you do things such as move tabs into a window, close tabs, etc. Although you can do those things manually, macros let you do it much faster and easier. This is especially useful if you do the same actions repeatedly.</p>

        <h3 id="how-do-make-macros">How do I make macros?</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>First, open the options page. On the left side, select the <span class="action">Macros</span> category. Use the <span class="action">New macro</span> button to create a macro. A macro is composed of three parts:
            <ol>
              <li>an action
                <p>This describes what the macro does.</p>
              </li>
              <li>a search query
                <p>This describes what tabs will be affected.</p>
              </li>
              <li>an optional window name
                <p>This specifies a <em>single</em> window within Tab Organizer. It must match <em>exactly</em>, including case sensitivity. If the window doesn't exist, it is created automatically. Leaving it blank means "new window".</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

        <h3 id="what-are-the-different-macro-actions">What are the different macro actions?</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>ignore</code></span>
              <p>This causes the tabs to be ignored by macros. This only affects macros lower in the list, not higher.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>require</code></span>
              <p>This action does two things. First, it takes tabs matching the search query, and moves them into the specified window. Second, it takes tabs that do <em>not</em> match the search query, and moves them <em>out</em> of the specified window.</p>
              <p>This allows you to divide tabs into windows based on their content. For instance, you may want all <code>wikipedia</code> tabs to be placed into the window named <span class="match">Wikipedia</span>, all the <code>youtube</code> tabs placed into the <span class="match">YouTube</span> window, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>move</code></span>
              <p>This is like <code>require</code> except it's one-way: it moves tabs into the window, but doesn't move non-matching tabs out. You can use this to collect many different kinds of tabs into a single window.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="emphasis"><code>close</code></span>
              <p>This closes the matching tabs. You can't specify a window when using this action.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Within Tab Organizer, select the <span class="action">Menu</span> button in the upper-left corner. Now select the <span class="action">Macros...</span> submenu, which shows a list of all your macros.</p>
          <p>You can trigger a single macro by selecting it, but there is also an <span class="action">Apply all macros</span> item, that triggers all the macros in sequence.</p>
          <p>Unlike triggering a single macro, <span class="action">Apply all macros</span> takes all the macros into account. Macros higher in the list have higher priority, and will override macros that are lower in the list.</p>
          <p>As an example, suppose you have these two macros:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>require <b>foo</b> in "Foo"</li>
              <li>require <b>bar</b> in "Bar"</li>
            </ol>
          <p>What if you have a tab that matches both <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>? It will be moved into the window <span class="match">Foo</span>, because that macro is higher in the list. This gives you control over how to handle these kinds of conflicts.

            <li>require <b>intitle:r/^File:/ | is:image</b> in "Images"
              <p>This makes sure that the window <span class="match">Images</span> contains tabs that are images. This includes Wiki tabs that are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LogicGates.svg">wrappers around images</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>require <b>is:broken</b> in "~Error"
              <p>This tries to find sites that are broken, and moves them into their own window to make it easy to find them.</p>

            <li>require <b>inurl:r/google.com\/(?:search|images|imgres)/</b> in "~Search"
              <p>Usually, I use Google to search for something, then end up leaving the search results page open even when I no longer need it. This macro moves them into their own window, making it easy to manually close them.</p>

            <li>require <b>wikipedia</b> in "Wikipedia"
              <p>I don't know about you, but I tend to read Wikipedia a lot, and end up with Wikipedia tabs scattered all over the place. This macro moves them into a single <span class="match">Wikipedia</span> window, thus causing less clutter.</p>

            <!--<li><span style="white-space: nowrap;">require <b>paul graham | scott berkun | inurl:joelonsoftware.com</b></span> in "Blogs"
              <p>I also read blogs by some people, and this macro moves them into the "Blogs" window. This shows how you can use the | operator to move different tabs into a single window.</p>
            </li>-->
            <li>require <b>inurl:youtube.com</b> in "YouTube"
              <p>This moves all the YouTube tabs into the <span class="match">YouTube</span> window.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>I use many others, but they tend to fit into my lifestyle and the kinds of tabs that I use. Make your own and experiment to find macros that work good for you.</p>

        <h3 id="can-you-explain-usage-tracking">Can you explain usage tracking?</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Tab Organizer uses Google Analytics, which is also used by many other websites. Google Analytics tracks many things, such as browser, screen resolution, time spent on the site, etc.</p>
          <p>However, I'm not interested in most of the information that Google Analytics gives me. I mostly use it to track the options page. This lets me see what settings are popular, so I can reorder them or change the defaults.</p>
          <p>You can disable usage tracking in the options page, in the <span class="match">Privacy</span> category. It will tell Google Analytics that you have disabled usage tracking. This lets me see how many users have disabled it. Nothing else is tracked in Tab Organizer after you disable usage tracking.</p>

        <h3 id="what-things-are-tracked">What things are tracked?</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>These things are tracked, and cannot be disabled in Tab Organizer:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>How many users have visited the FAQ page.</li>
            <li>How many users have visited the recent changes/changelog page.</li>

            <li>What issues are most visited.</li>

          <p>These things are tracked, but can be disabled:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>How frequently users reload Tab Organizer (this usually means restarting Chrome).</li>
            <li>How frequently users open the popup.</li>

        <h3 id="why-is-usage-tracking-enabled-by-default">Why is usage tracking enabled by default?</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Simply because the information provided is anonymous, and has already been useful for improving Tab Organizer. Unfortunately, if it was disabled by default, I think most users would not enable it, even if they didn't have a problem with usage tracking.</p>
          <p>I think that the information that Tab Organizer tracks is not personal, and that most users would not have a problem with me using this information to help make Tab Organizer better for everybody.</p>
          <p>However, if I'm wrong, and most users would in fact object to usage tracking, then I would seriously consider having it off by default.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3 id="how-has-usage-tracking-been-beneficial">How has usage tracking been beneficial?</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>When Tab Organizer first got keyboard shortcut support, the default was <span class="nowrap"><code class="key">Ctrl</code> + <code class="key">Shift</code> + <code class="key">O</code></span>. Unfortunately, this shortcut is difficult for QWERTY users to use, and might be mistaken as <span class="nowrap"><code class="key">Ctrl</code> + <code class="key">O</code></span> (which means <span class="action">Open</span> in Chrome).</p>
          <p>By using Google Analytics, I was able to see what keyboard shortcuts were popular. I didn't like most of the popular ones, but one in particular I liked: <span class="nowrap"><code class="key">Ctrl</code> + <code class="key">Shift</code> + <code class="key">E</code></span>.</p>
          <p>This is easy to use for both QWERTY and Dvorak users, and I am unaware of any conflicts with Chrome. If I had not used usage tracking, the default might still be <span class="nowrap"><code class="key">Ctrl</code> + <code class="key">Shift</code> + <code class="key">O</code></span>, despite it being worse.</p>
          <p>As another example: in the options page, the <span class="action">Keyboard</span> category used to be at the top, with <span class="action">Theme</span> being second. By using Google Analytics, I noticed that <span class="action">Theme</span> was more popular, so I changed <span class="action">Theme</span> to be the first category.</p>
          <p>Usage tracking is also great for experimental features, which must be enabled in the options page. By seeing how many users use experimental features, I can make a more educated decision about whether to support them or not.</p>
